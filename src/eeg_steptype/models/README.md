# Models

This directory contains the model factories and the per-participant training
driver. The driver (`train.py`) is generic: it picks a factory by name, applies
a configurable feature-selection schedule, runs nested cross-validation, and
returns fold-level metrics.

```
train.py                — generic train/eval driver (nested CV, refits, parallel)
feature_selection.py    — correlation drop, k-best, RFECV, gain prune, SHAP prune
evaluate.py             — per-participant metrics + cohort rollup
normalization.py        — wraps factories in StandardScaler etc. when required
xgb.py                  — XGBoost factory (primary model)
svm.py                  — sklearn SVC factory (comparator)
logistic.py             — sklearn LogisticRegression factory (baseline / smoke)
lstm.py                 — Keras Sequential BiLSTM factory (deep comparator)
riemannian.py           — covariance-based comparator (XdawnCovariances + MDM)
cnn.py                  — convolutional comparator (Braindecode-style)
eegnet.py               — compact EEGNet hybrid (Keras; max-norm constraints)
eegnet_torch.py         — PyTorch port of eegnet (nn.Module + sklearn wrapper)
eegnext.py              — multi-scale + SE-attention + residual hybrid CNN
```

Every model is registered in `MODEL_FACTORIES` in `train.py`. Pick one on the
CLI with `--model {xgb,svm,lstm,logistic,riemannian,cnn,eegnet,eegnet_torch,eegnext}`.

## Training driver — what `train.py` does

For each participant the driver runs nested CV:

1. **Outer CV** — `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` (default) or `StratifiedGroupKFold`
   (grouped) or chronological `KFold`. Configured under `modeling.cv`.
2. Inside each outer fold:
   1. **Correlation drop** — drop one of every |corr|>θ pair (cheap).
   2. **ANOVA F-test** — keep the top-K features.
   3. **Iterated RFECV** *(XGB only; togglable)* — N runs of RFECV with the
      XGB RFECV base estimator, take the union of consistently-kept features
      and the top 80% by mean importance.
   4. **Hyperparameter search** — `HalvingRandomSearchCV` for XGB,
      `GridSearchCV` for others. Inner CV is `StratifiedKFold`.
   5. **Gain prune** *(togglable)* — drop features with zero (or low) XGB
      gain importance, then refit the search on the smaller column set.
   6. **SHAP prune** *(togglable)* — drop the bottom quantile by mean |SHAP|,
      then refit one more time.
3. **Score** the final estimator on the held-out fold; record metrics.

Per-participant metrics are checkpointed to
`outputs/runs/<run_id>/participants/<pid>_metrics.csv`. The cohort metrics CSV
and rollup are written to the run root when all participants finish.

### Parallel participants

When `modeling.parallel.participants > 1` (or `--parallel-participants N` is
passed on the CLI), the driver dispatches participants over a joblib `loky`
pool. Inside each worker the inner XGBoost / sklearn `n_jobs` is pinned to 1
so the joblib pool doesn't oversubscribe the CPU. This is the biggest single
wall-time win once the per-participant work is already trimmed by a speed
tier (see `configs/README.md`).

### Feature-selection toggles

| Config key                          | Default | Effect when `false`                                  |
|-------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `modeling.rfecv.enabled`            | `true`  | Skip the iterated RFECV pass entirely.               |
| `modeling.gain_prune.enabled`       | `true`  | Skip gain-prune column subset and its refit.         |
| `modeling.gain_prune.refit`         | `true`  | Compute gain importances but don't refit afterwards. |
| `modeling.shap_prune.enabled`       | derived | Skip the SHAP-prune column subset and its refit.     |
| `modeling.shap_prune.refit`         | `true`  | Don't refit after SHAP pruning.                      |
| `modeling.shap_prune.quantile`      | `0.2`   | Threshold for dropping low-|SHAP| features.          |

Legacy key `modeling.shap_prune_quantile` is still honored if the new
`shap_prune` block isn't provided.

## Model architectures

### XGBoost (`xgb.py`) — primary

Gradient-boosted decision trees via `xgboost.XGBClassifier`.

- **Objective**: `binary:logistic`.
- **Tree method**: `hist` (fast histogram-based splits).
- **Class imbalance**: per-fold `scale_pos_weight = neg/pos`.
- **n_estimators**: up to `modeling.xgb.n_estimators` (default 1000; tier configs
  trim this to 200/400/600). Halving search uses `n_estimators` as its
  successive-halving resource budget.
- **Search grid** (`modeling.xgb.param_grid`): `max_depth`, `min_child_weight`,
  `reg_alpha`, `gamma`, `reg_lambda`, `colsample_bytree`, `colsample_bylevel`,
  `learning_rate`, `subsample`.
- **RFECV base** (`make_rfecv_base`): smaller XGB (800 trees, depth 4,
  learning_rate 0.05) used inside `RFECV` to keep that step affordable.

Why it's the primary model: XGBoost handles wide, mixed-scale tabular features
(amplitude bins, slopes, band powers, source-space activations) without
hand-tuned preprocessing, supports `feature_importances_` and SHAP for the
prune stages, and ships with native multithreading.

### SVM (`svm.py`) — comparator

`sklearn.svm.SVC` with `probability=True` and `class_weight="balanced"`.

- **Kernels**: `rbf`, `linear`, `poly` (grid-selected).
- **Hyperparameters**: `C`, `gamma`, `degree` for poly.
- **Preprocessing**: wrapped in `StandardScaler` via `normalization.maybe_wrap_estimator`.
- **Feature selection**: correlation drop and ANOVA k-best only — no RFECV,
  gain, or SHAP (no `feature_importances_`).

Good for confirming whether the gains XGB sees are tree-specific.

### Logistic regression (`logistic.py`) — baseline / smoke

`sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` with `solver="liblinear"`,
`class_weight="balanced"`, `max_iter=2000`.

- **Hyperparameters**: just `C`.
- **Preprocessing**: `StandardScaler` wrapper.
- **Purpose**: smoke-test target (fast end-to-end pipeline check) and linear
  baseline for the comparator table.

### Bidirectional LSTM (`lstm.py`) — deep comparator

Built lazily so the package imports without TensorFlow installed.

```
Input(shape=(n_timesteps, n_features))
Bidirectional(LSTM(units, return_sequences=False))
Dropout(dropout)
Dense(32, activation="relu")
Dense(1, activation="sigmoid")
```

- **Optimizer**: `adam`, loss `binary_crossentropy`.
- **Hyperparameters**: `units` and `dropout` (grid via `modeling.lstm.units_grid`
  / `dropout_grid`).
- **Training**: `epochs=50`, `batch_size=32` by default.
- **Wrapper**: `scikeras.wrappers.KerasClassifier` so it plugs into the same
  GridSearchCV path as the classical models.

The current driver passes one timestep per feature (legacy CNV_LSTM_3.py
behaviour). True per-timestep windowing is left for a future revision.

### Riemannian (`riemannian.py`) — covariance-based comparator

Tensor-input pipeline that runs directly on `(n_epochs, n_channels, n_times)`
rather than the flat feature parquet. Architecture:

```
RiemannianFeatureUnion(
    xDAWN covariance        -> tangent space  (nfilter sweeps 2/4/6),
    broadband covariance    -> tangent space,
    FBCSP log-variance      (Mu, Beta bands),
) -> concatenate -> BalancedShrinkageLDA (priors=[0.5, 0.5])
```

- **Covariance estimator**: OAS shrinkage by default (`modeling.riemannian.covariance_estimator`); the search grid also sweeps Ledoit-Wolf (`lwf`).
- **xDAWN**: spatial filter tuned for ERP/SCP shapes -- a good fit for the CNV. `nfilter` swept 2/4/6 in the grid.
- **FBCSP block**: log-variance features for Mu (8-13 Hz) and Beta (13-30 Hz). Filtering itself is left to the eventual tensor-data preprocessing path; the block captures the fold-local contract today.
- **Final classifier**: `BalancedShrinkageLDA` — `sklearn`'s LDA with `solver=lsqr`, `shrinkage=auto`, `priors=[0.5, 0.5]` for minor class imbalance.
- **Feature selection**: none. Correlation drop, k-best, RFECV, gain-prune, SHAP-prune are all skipped by the tensor-input training path — they're undefined on `(n_epochs, n_channels, n_times)` input.
- **Data path**: reads cached `.npz` tensors from `data/features/tensor/`, built on first use by `features.tensor.build_tensor_for_participant`. The classical feature parquet is never touched.
- **Window**: defaults to `full_cnv` (0-2 s) via the `riemannian` overlay because covariance structure changes meaningfully across the whole motor-preparation interval.

Activate end-to-end with:

```bash
python run.py --speed-tier riemannian              # tier sets default_model: riemannian
python run.py --speed-tier riemannian --model riemannian   # explicit form
```

### CNN / EEGNet — hybrid neural comparators

`cnn.py` and `eegnet.py` run compact convolutional neural networks on the raw
epoch tensor, then fuse that representation with the same tabular feature
matrix used by the XGB path. The tabular branch is built by
`features.assemble`, so it can include binned amplitude statistics, slopes,
PSD band powers, and source-space activations from `data/src/*.csv`.

- **Tensor branch**: cleaned scalp EEG as `(n_epochs, n_channels, n_times)`.
- **Tabular branch**: XGB-style per-epoch features, including source columns
  when the `src` block is present and the source-localization stage has run.
- **Channel summary features**: the CNN/EEGNet config enables binned
  `mean`, `std`, `min`, and `max` amplitude features at 0.0625 s resolution.
- **Fusion**: the flattened convolutional branch is concatenated with a small
  dense tabular branch before the final sigmoid classifier.
- **Source requirement**: the CNN/EEGNet overlays set
  `modeling.<model>.tabular_features.require_source: true`, so runs fail
  loudly if source-space columns are missing instead of silently training on
  channels only.

With `run.py`, neural `train` requests automatically include `src` and
`features` first, so a cold run can be launched with:

```bash
python run.py --speed-tier eegnet --participants P25 --stages train
```

### EEGNeXt (`eegnext.py`) — sophisticated hybrid CNN

`eegnext.py` is a more sophisticated CNN built on the same EEGNet-lite block, for
when the compact `cnn`/`eegnet` comparators leave signal on the table. It keeps
the hybrid tensor + tabular fusion but upgrades the convolutional core in three
ways:

- **Multi-scale temporal stem**: several temporal convolutions with *different*
  kernel lengths run in parallel and are concatenated, capturing
  delta/theta/alpha/beta timescales in one layer instead of betting on a single
  kernel (`model__temporal_kernels`, default `[16, 32, 64]`).
- **Squeeze-and-Excitation channel attention**: a small gating branch reweights
  the feature maps by their global informativeness (`model__se_ratio`).
- **Residual separable blocks**: depth is added through separable convolutions
  wrapped in skip connections (`model__n_residual_blocks`), so the network can be
  deeper without the usual optimisation cost on small per-participant data.

It is registered like the other neural models (`data_representation: tensor`,
hybrid fusion, `require_source: true`) and runs on the full-CNV window:

```bash
python run.py --speed-tier eegnext --participants P25 --stages train
```

**Performance recording & diagnostics** are the same model-generic tools the
other models use — `eegnext` is wired into all of them, no bespoke tooling:

- **Per-run metrics**: every training run writes `outputs/runs/<run_id>/`
  (`metrics.csv`, `rollup.csv`, config snapshot, git SHA) via the generic
  `train.py` → `evaluate.py` path. `scripts/05_visualize.py` plots it.
- **Cross-model screening** (`scripts/06_compare_runs.py`) aggregates runs into
  the five diagnostics (AUC ± CI, tier slope, fold variance, inner-vs-outer gap,
  per-participant ranking); `eegnext` is recognised as a tensor-model tier.
- **Occlusion diagnostics** (`scripts/08_tensor_model_diagnostics.py`) — the
  same channel/time-occlusion probe used for `cnn`/`eegnet`:

  ```bash
  python scripts/08_tensor_model_diagnostics.py --model eegnext \
      --run outputs/runs/<eegnext_run_id> --participants P25
  ```
